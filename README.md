## Overview

We built an AI-powered tool that helps users assess the safety of their drinking water based on pH values from Santa Clara Valley Water. By using OpenAI‚Äôs GPT-3.5, the tool instantly evaluates whether input values fall within safe EPA drinking water standards, and offers a concise, human-readable explanation.

## Water Quality Advisory Tool: What is it?

This tool is designed to simplify complex environmental data and make it understandable to the public. Users input a pH value, and the application uses generative AI to return a safety assessment along with a clear explanation tailored to everyday users. The tool was developed using Streamlit to provide an accessible web interface.

## Why the Water Quality Advisory Tool?

Water reports often include pH and mineral values that are unfamiliar or confusing to the average person. Even though the data is public, it‚Äôs not always actionable. Residents may drink or cook with tap water without knowing whether it's safe, especially in underserved areas or after heavy storms or maintenance activity.

- Existing public water data:

- Is published in scientific units not easily interpreted by the average resident  
- Requires cross-referencing with EPA safety guidelines  
- Offers no interactive or dynamic interpretation  

Our AI-powered tool introduces a more helpful approach by:

- Accepting user-submitted pH values from Santa Clara Valley Water reports  
- Automatically generating AI-based recommendations on water safety  
- Presenting results in clear, digestible language  
- Encouraging residents to stay informed and take proactive action if water conditions are unsafe  
- Bridging the gap between raw environmental data and meaningful health awareness  

Ultimately, this project aims to democratize water safety information and empower users with insights previously buried in static reports.

## Our Solution

Our solution consists of a multi-page Streamlit application designed to educate users and help them evaluate water safety using public pH data. The tool is structured around three key components:

### üè† Main Page
Introduces the Water Quality Advisory Tool, its purpose, and how users can benefit from it. This page sets the context for the application, explaining how understanding water quality ‚Äî particularly pH ‚Äî can impact public health.

### üß™ pH Tool
This is the core feature of the app. Users input a pH value from Santa Clara Valley Water reports, and the tool uses OpenAI‚Äôs GPT-3.5 model to evaluate the value against EPA drinking water standards. It generates a safety assessment and explains the implications in simple language.

- Validates and interprets numeric pH inputs  
- Delivers AI-generated safety summaries  
- Helps users understand if their water falls within a safe range  

### üìö Water Education
A fully educational page designed to improve public understanding of water quality terms and issues. It breaks down complex topics like pH, contaminants, and their health effects into simple, readable sections. This page supports environmental awareness and informed decision-making.

- Defines key water quality concepts  
- Explains the significance of pH and other elements  
- Empowers users with accessible environmental knowledge  

Together, these pages offer a complete experience ‚Äî from analysis to education ‚Äî helping users take control of understanding the water they rely on daily.

**Accessible Interface:**  
Streamlit provides a responsive and user-friendly platform that allows anyone to access the tool via a browser without technical expertise.

The interface and logic are structured to prioritize clarity, ease of use, and reliability. In the future, we plan to extend this system with additional metrics (e.g., mineral levels), CSV uploads, and multi-lingual support.
